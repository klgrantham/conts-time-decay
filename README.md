# Accounting for a decaying correlation structure in cluster randomized trials with continuous recruitment

This repository provides `R` code to assess and compare different cluster randomized trial models and designs, focusing on a model with a new within-cluster correlation structure. Under this continuous-time correlation decay structure, the correlation between subjects' outcomes in a cluster are assumed to decrease, or decay, as the time between these subjects' measurement times increases. Incorrectly assuming that subjects' outcomes in a cluster are equally correlated may underestimate the required sample size for stepped wedge and cluster randomized crossover designs, resulting in an underpowered trial.
